## 3. Abstract

If you look at the profile picture or SNS of a friend who has been on a trip, you can easily find the pictures taken with the background of the wonderful scenery, a good restaurant or special place. You will also be familiar with the way people who has been on a pleasant trip bragged about it and encouraged you to visit there because it's a good place. Humans have a desire to share good experiences with people around them, such as visiting great places. In view of this, our team decided to develop an application to create a platform where individuals can share their own places with friends and give them missions or hold events.
